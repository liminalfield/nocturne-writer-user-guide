# Nocturne Writer User Guide

This User Guide provides orientation and essential information for using Nocturne Writer. It is intentionally concise; additional documentation will be added as the beta progresses and features stabilize.


## What This Guide Contains 

At present, the User Guide includes a small number of foundational sections:  

1. [Welcome to Nocturne Writer](https://www.github.com/1): An introduction to Nocturne Writer and its overall intent.  

2. [Your First Hour with Nocturne Writer](https://www.github.com/2):  Guidance for getting started and establishing an initial workflow.  

3. [Beta Information](https://www.github.com/3): Details specific to beta builds, including versioning, limitations, and feedback.  Additional documentation will be added as the beta progresses.


## How to Use This Guide

This guide is designed to be read **alongside the application**.

It focuses on:

* Orientation and early use

* Understanding intent and behaviour

* Building confidence in core workflows

It does not attempt to be exhaustive or prescriptive.


## Format and Availability

This User Guide is authored and maintained as a **Nocturne Writer book**.

It is designed to be:

* Read inside Nocturne Writer as an integrated guide

* Navigated as a structured, long-form document

* Maintained alongside the application during the beta period

The guide is written in plain Markdown and may also be viewed externally using any Markdown-compatible reader.

No proprietary tooling is required to access the documentation.
